An acylpolyamines contains an (usually) aromatic head moiety, a polyamine backbone chain of various length and an alkaline tail. Optional an amino acid linker, such as asparagine, can be part of the molecule. Polyamine toxins can be divided in single parts, a head, several polyamine backchain units and a tail. As an example the first fully characterized acylpolyamine, Arg 636, is shown above.

Historically, acylpolyamines got trivial names. These names are a combination of two to four letters stating the species or family of the spider venom in which the toxin was found and a number related to its nominal mass. This practice has several drawbacks. Isomeric strcutures demanded the extansion of the trivial names with additional letters which was done randomly. In addition, acylpolyamines found in the venom of different spider species got several trivial names. The consequence is that the literature became confusing and cross references became very difficult.
On venoMS we use the generic nomenclature for acylpolyamines introduced by us in [2001](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/1522-2675%2820010815%2984%3A8%3C2178%3A%3AAID-HLCA2178%3E3.0.CO%3B2-N). The generic nomenclature uses abbreviations for the head groups, amino acid linkers and tail moieties. The polyamine chain is described by numbers representing the number of methylen groups in between the nitrogen atoms and a substitution of an amine is indicated in brackets. Therefore, the generic name of Arg 636 is 2,4-(OH)â‚‚-PhAcAsn533Arg. Even trough the generic names are slightly longer, they are distinct and provide structural information.
