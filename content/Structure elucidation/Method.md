##### Sample preparation
The lyophilized spider venom was dissolved in H₂O/MeCN 3:1 + 0.05% TFA to a concentration of 1 μg/μl. Reference compounds were dissolved in H₂O/MeCN 3:1 + 0.05% TFA to a concentration of 10 μg/ml. All samples were stored at –20 °C prior to their use.

##### Instruments
The UHPLC-ESI-MS and MS/MS experiments were performed on a Dionex UltiMate 3000 HPLC instrument (Thermo Scientific, Germering, Germany) equipped with an autosampler, a pump and a diode-array detector (DAD) of the same producer series. The UHPLC system was connected to a QExactive Orbitrap FT mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) equipped with an HESI source.

##### UHPLC method
The samples were chromatographed at a flow rate of 0.30 ml/min on a RP-C18+ column (CortecsTM UPLC® C18+ 1.6 μm, 2.1x150 mm, Waters, Milford, MA, USA) with solvents A and B consisting of H₂O + 0.05% TFA and MeCN/H₂O 8:2 [v/v] + 0.05% TFA, respectively. The column chamber temperature was set to 25 °C. The samples were injected at a volume of 1 μl. The strong wash was MeOH and weak wash H₂O/MeCN 95:5 [v/v]. The gradient went from 3.8 to 25% of eluent B over 22 min. Finally, the column was regenerated at 100% B for 4 min and equilibrated at 3.8% B over 6 min.

##### HR-MS and MS/MS
 The MS conditions were: sheath gas flow rate (N₂, 48), aux gas flow rate (N₂, 11), aux gas heater temperature (320 °C) and sweep gas flow rate (N₂, 2), spray voltage (3.5 kV), S-lens RF level (55), capillary temperature (256 °C). Full scan MS were performed in positive ion mode at 70’000 resolutions and was detected between m/z 100 to 1500. The AGC target setting for full scan MS experiment was set to 10⁶ with a maximum of 30 injection times. The mass spectrometer was calibrated for mass accuracy once a day according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The relative mass error being typically lower than 3 ppm (externally).

The MS/MS experiments were acquired in Full MS/dd-MS2 (Top N) mode with a resolving power of 17’500. The acquisition was performed with an isolation window set to 0.8 m/z. The AGC target setting was set to 10⁵. The normalized collision energy (NCE) was set to a gradient (30, 35, 40. The MS/MS spectra were recorded of the top five ions.

##### Hydrogen/Deuterium exchange
For chromatography, the solvents A and B consisted of D₂O + 0.05% d₁-TFA and MeCN/D₂O 8:2 [v/v] + 0.05% d₁-TFA, respectively. The column chamber temperature was set to 40 °C. All other parameters remained the same.

##### Chemicals
HPLC grade H₂O (< 5ppb) was obtained by purification of deionized H₂O with a MilliQ gradient apparatus (Millipore, Milford, MA, USA). Acetonitrile (MeCN, ULC/MS grade) and trifluoroacidic acid (TFA) were obtained from Biosolve (Valkenswaard, Netherland), D₂O (99.9 atom % D) from Sigma-Aldrich (Steinheim, Germany) and d₁-TFA (D 99.5%) from Cambridge Isotop Laboratories, Inc. (Andover, MA, USA).
